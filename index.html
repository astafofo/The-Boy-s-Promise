        <div class="story">
            <p>There was a boy who met a girl unlike anyone else. She was bright, kind, and full of life. Every time they talked, he felt something special, something he couldn’t put into words.</p>
            <p>But the boy had a path to walk—a long, difficult road. He wasn’t ready yet, not because he didn’t care, but because he wanted to be someone who could stand beside her with confidence. So, he kept his feelings inside, not because they weren’t real, but because the right time hadn’t come.</p>
            <p>The girl? She was amazing just as she was. She shined on her own, and the boy admired that. He worked hard, pushing forward, knowing that one day, when he was strong enough, when everything was right—he would stand before her, not just as a friend, but as the person she truly deserved.</p>
            <p>And on that day, neither of them would have to hold back. They would just smile, knowing that the wait was worth it. <3</p>
